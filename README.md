## Why is important?


A net revenue management agenda is crucial for any organization as it's all about boosting revenue by smartly handling pricing, promotions, and product availability to make the most profit. 

Here's why it's so important:

- **Maximizing Profits:** It helps ensure we're earning as much as possible from our products or services without turning away customers with overly high prices.

- **Optimizing Product Availability:** By making sure our products are available when and where customers want them, we avoid losing sales due to shortages or excess inventory.

- **Balancing Demand and Supply:** We can match our product supply with customer demand, adjusting prices and promotions to encourage sales during slow times or manage demand during busy periods.

- **Enhancing Customer Satisfaction:** Offering the right products at the right price and time improves customer happiness, leading to repeat business and positive word-of-mouth.

- **Competitive Advantage:** It gives us an edge by allowing us to respond swiftly to market changes, outsmart competitors, and grab more market share.

- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** By analyzing data on customer behavior, market trends, and competitor actions, we can make informed decisions to boost revenue and profits.

In a nutshell, a net revenue management agenda is absolutely essential for any organization because it helps us achieve our strategic and financial goals effectively.

The points mentioned above highlight why implementing a **net revenue management (NRM)** agenda is crucial. However, what's equally important is understanding how to develop such an agenda. While **pricing** is the ultimate output of the program, the key lies in identifying opportunities through data analysis for **revenue growth.** 

Therefore, the most critical aspect is harnessing the power of data. Ultimately, **NRM** empowers organizations to effectively leverage available data for sustainable growth. In this article, we'll delve into the essential steps and considerations for begin to develop a successful NRM agenda that drives revenue growth through data utilization.


## The roadmap


*`1.-Brand portfolio pricing:`*
- The initial step in the revenue management roadmap involves understanding how pricing impacts demand.At this stage, it's crucial to consider factors like equity and our competitive advantage within the segment.Conducting an elasticity test is also essential to gauge market sensitivity to price changes. This helps answer the pivotal question:<br><center>**"Which is the right price?"**.</center><br> Also it's important to consider both market prices and competitor pricing during this phase of the roadmap.

*`2.-Price architecture`*
- another thing to consider is the next, the architecture of the price is important how need to be estructured the price and which price is the most attractive? in the last question is very common in some business to see prices with odd ending and during promotions times with 99 or 95 endings and this is very important because despite the elasticity is important to consider de psicologycal pricing and the current stage which is the most attractive price, also we need to consider that the endings not increase the demand all the time and not work by itself in all products in the article "Estimating the effect of odd pricing" from Philip Gendall show us that the price ending 99 is more effective for low-priced and fast-moving products
  
*`3.-Mix management`*
- The mix management stage is super important because we need a smart plan that considers all our different products (if we have them). This helps us find the best mix and make the most money. Remember how we talked about setting prices like \\$9.99 or \\$9.95 earlier? Well, that matters here too. We need to use different math tricks, like optimization algorithms, to find the best balance for all the stuff we're selling. We can use tools like linear programming to figure out the best way to do this.

*`4.-Promotion management`*
- When planning how to make more money, we need to think about promotions too. To do this, we can use a tool called marketing mix analysis. This helps us understand how things like advertising, prices, promotions, and discounts affect sales.

  It's really important to understand how each of these things affects how much people want to buy, and to know when, where, and why they decide to buy. This helps us see what makes people want to buy more, and what doesn't.

  To figure this out, we can use something called causal inference. This helps us understand if things like discounts actually make people buy more, or if things like Christmas make people want to buy more.
  
*`5.-Trade terms management`*
- In the final step of many businesses, we need to make sure that our commercial terms match our prices. In businesses that sell to other businesses (B2B), we can create a pricing plan with different levels. We start with a basic price, then adjust it based on how much demand there is. The goal is to come up with a pricing plan where both sides feel like they're getting a good deal.
